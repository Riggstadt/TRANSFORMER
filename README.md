# TRANSFORMER
Low power single-phase transformer for university assignment

## INTRODUCTION
This repository contains my homework assignment for the Passive Components and Circuits course I undertook while at ETTI Bucuresti.
The assignment covered the simulation of several low power circuits and the design process of the step-down transformer necessary for powering them.

The transformer's behaviour was modelled according to a simplified component model.
The circuit analysis was performed by hand using the Loop Current Method and verified via a MATLAB script and additional PSpice simulations.

More detalied explanations of the work undertaken can be found inside the documents provided in this repository.
